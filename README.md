# Project README

## Overview

This project involves several tasks including running different jobs on LLaMA models, evaluating metrics for classification, running Graft with detailed phrases, and evaluating summaries. Below are the detailed steps and instructions for each task.

## Tasks

### 1. Run Another Job on LLaMA2

- **Description:** Cloned the LLaMA repository and can now run jobs using LLaMA2 instead of LLaMA 13b.
- **Instructions:**
  1. Ensure LLaMA2 is properly set up in the repository.
  2. Adjust the script or job configurations to use LLaMA2 as required.

### 2. Evaluate Metrics for Graft, NAIP, and CLIP

- **Description:** Evaluate the performance metrics of Graft, NAIP, and CLIP for classification tasks to compare their performance.
- **Instructions:**
  1. Run the classification tasks using Graft, NAIP, and CLIP models.
  2. Collect the performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
  3. Compare the metrics to evaluate the relative performance of each model.

### 3. Run Graft with Detailed Phrases

- **Description:** Execute Graft with the mode set to detailed phrases to enhance the granularity and richness of the output.
- **Instructions:**
  1. Configure Graft to operate in detailed phrases mode.
  2. Run the Graft model with the appropriate datasets and settings.

### 4. Current Running Job: Summarization

- **Description:** Currently running a summarization job, which is expected to take approximately 4 hours.
- **Instructions:**
  1. Monitor the summarization job to ensure it completes successfully.
  2. Upon completion, proceed to evaluate the quality of the summaries.

### Evaluating Summaries

- **Need to Find a Metric for Evaluating Summaries:**
  - **Possible Metrics:**
    1. **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation):** Measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and word pairs between the generated summary and reference summaries.
    2. **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy):** Measures the precision of n-grams in the generated summary compared to reference summaries.
    3. **Human Evaluation:** Assess summaries based on relevance, conciseness, coherence, fluency, and coverage.
    4. **Task-Based Evaluation:** Evaluate how well the summaries support specific tasks, such as information retrieval or decision making.
- **Instructions:**
  1. Choose one or more metrics for evaluating the summaries.
  2. Apply the chosen metrics to assess the quality of the generated summaries.
  3. Document the evaluation results and insights.

## Conclusion

This README provides a structured outline for the tasks related to running jobs on LLaMA models, evaluating classification metrics, running Graft with detailed phrases, and evaluating summaries. Follow the instructions for each task to ensure successful completion and accurate evaluation.
